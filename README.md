# CoinApp

The design and architectural patterns were selected in alignment with the provided guidelines, aiming for a coherent and consistent approach. The decision to employ the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern was made to enhance collaboration with team members during the project's subsequent phases and to promote codebase maintainability. MVVM effectively segregates presentation logic from the user interface, simplifying code management, and extensibility, while offering a structured framework for the project.

The aspect of the app that would benefit from more development and improvement is the design. Specifically, there is a need to create a more suitable and aesthetically pleasing design, with particular focus on enhancing the 'Details' section. This involves refining the user interface, optimizing user experience, and addressing any usability issues. Furthermore, a comprehensive redesign can contribute to a more polished and user-friendly application. 

Yes, the application is ready for submission to the App Store. However, I believe that further improving the design could result in a significantly enhanced user experience. Additionally, conducting thorough testing, addressing any potential usability issues, and incorporating user feedback can contribute to a more polished and user-friendly product before submission.

To optimize the project's overall output, a more refined approach for sharing and collaborating on design, potentially leveraging platforms such as Figma, could be considered. This would facilitate a deeper understanding of the design rationale for developers. Ultimately, this could lead to a more efficient development process.

Regarding the requirements for running the project, no specific tools are necessary. The project can be opened exclusively with Xcode. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the SDWebImageSVGCoder and Alamofire frameworks have been included via the Swift Package Manager, eliminating the need for running 'pod install.' This streamlined setup ensures that the project is readily accessible and that all dependencies are seamlessly managed through the Swift Package Manager, simplifying the development environment and reducing any potential compatibility issues.
